The median of medians is an approximate median-selection algorithm that helps building an asymptotically optimal, exact general selection algorithm (especially in the sense of worst-case complexity), by producing good pivot elements. 
</p>
<p>
The median of medians operates similiary to quickselect, choosing one element as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot. It then recurses into one side – the side with the element it is searching for. Where it differs from Quickselect is the way it chooses the pivot, thereby having a better worst-case performance but worse average performance as it's constants are bigger due to higher complexity when choosing a pivot.

	<b>Time complexity: </b> It has an expected running time of O(n) in both the worst and best case.
