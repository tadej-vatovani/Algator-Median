    Here Quickselect falls behind, since the data is a sorted array. Quickselect selects the pivot as the last element of the array, which in turn causes the worst case scenario. Meanwhile both MedianOfMedians and FloydRivest choose the pivot more optimally which means that they don't have a bad worst case complexity.
