The Floyd-Rivest algorithm is a selection algorithm developed by Robert W. Floyd and Ronald L. Rivest that has an optimal expected number of comparisons within lower-order terms. It is functionally equivalent to quickselect, but runs faster in practice on average.
</p>
<p>
The Floyd-Rivest algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm, sharing many similarities with quickselect. It uses sampling to help partition the list into three sets. It then recursively selects the kth smallest element from the appropriate set.

	<b>Time complexity: </b> It has an expected running time of O(n) in both the worst and best case.
