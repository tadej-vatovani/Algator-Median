	This algortihm is implemented by using a sorting algorithm and then simply taking the middle element from the sorted array. The sorting algortihm we used is quick sort.

	<b>Time complexity: </b> The time complexitiy is equal to the complexity of the sorting algorithm. On average, quicksort takes \( O(n \log n) \) comparisons to sort \( n \) items. In the worst case, it makes \( O(n^2) \) comparisons, though this behavior is rare.
