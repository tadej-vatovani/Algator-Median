The Quickselect algorithm, also known as the FIND algorithm, is a selection algorithm developed by Tony Hoare. Like quicksort, it is efficient in practice and has good average-case performance, but has poor worst-case performance.

<p>
Quickselect uses the same overall approach as quicksort, choosing one element as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot. However, instead of recursing into both sides, as in quicksort, quickselect only recurses into one side â€“ the side with the element it is searching for.

	<b>Time complexity: </b> It has an expected running time of O(n) and a worst-case complexity of O(n^2)
