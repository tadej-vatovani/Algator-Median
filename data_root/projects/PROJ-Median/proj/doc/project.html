	The median selection algorithm is a subset of selection algorithms. 
	A selection algorithm is an algorithm for finding the kth smallest 
	number in a list or array; such a number is called the kth order statistic.

	The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half 
	of a data sample (a population or a probability distribution). For a data 
	set, it may be thought of as the "middle" value. To simplify the problem 
	we focus on the <code>(floor(array.size/2) + 1)-smallest</code> element.
	This means that we ignore the case when the list has an even amount of elements.
